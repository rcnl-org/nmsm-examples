Things to Talk About Tomorrow

automatic scaling??

Kinematics define the state
Controls are synergy activations or torques
Initial Time, always constant?
Final Time, ask for range? vs ask for final time upper/lower
Guess is just data inputs?
Initial guess of parameters is baked into parameter definition?

Do we only do single phase?

Bounds:
	initial state bounds
		can initial state change?
		by how much?
	final state bounds
		can final state change?
		by how much?
	state bounds
		obviously states can change
		how to control how much state changes
		is state only kinematics?
		can use add time-variable 
	can you explain path constraints again?
	control bounds
		can change? yes
		should they always be bounded 0-1?
		how to describe bounds amount? by percent??
	please explain integrals and integral bounds
	duration upper/lower
		boolean element
		how much? range
	define static parameters
		if it's a static parameter it changes
		upper and lower bounds
	
Endpoint:
	objective
		how to let user add more objectives??
	what are eventgroups and do we care?

Continuous:
	How do we calculate the dynamics??
	what is a path and integrand
	
	do you have examples of endpoint cost terms vs continuous cost terms?
